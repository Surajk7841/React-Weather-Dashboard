## Description 

The "Openweathermap" project, developed using React.js and powered by a secured API key, provides users with a seamless weather information experience. Users can input a city and click "Add City" to swiftly access real-time data, displaying the city's name and temperature in degrees Celsius within a card below the input. Multiple cities can be added, resulting in multiple cards, each equipped with a delete button for easy removal. The project features a straightforward and user-friendly UI, ensuring effortless access to accurate weather data sourced from Openweathermap.org.
